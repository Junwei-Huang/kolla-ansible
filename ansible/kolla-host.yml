# NOTE(pbourke): This case covers deploying subsets of hosts using --limit. The
# limit arg will cause the first play to gather facts only about that node,
# meaning facts such as IP addresses for rabbitmq nodes etc. will be undefined
# in the case of adding a single compute node.
# We don't want to add the delegate parameters to the above play as it will
# result in ((num_nodes-1)^2) number of SSHs when running for all nodes
# which can be very inefficient.
